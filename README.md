## For Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 mods

As you may be aware, **Puyo Puyo Tetris 2** runs on ***Hedgehog Engine 2***, the same engine used in _Sonic Forces, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 and Olympic Games Tokyo 2020: The Video Game_.

So for the sake of simplicity, I suggest you use the tool called **HedgeModManager**, which you can download [right here](https://github.com/thesupersonic16/HedgeModManager).

After you finish downloading the tool, just extract the executable anywhere you wish. If you have the game installed on Steam, it should automatically detect the game after you run it.

1. Download the .zip archive of the mod you chose.
2. Run **HedgeModManager**.
3. Click **Add Mod**.
4. Select the **“Installing from an archive”** option.
5. Find the .zip archive of the mod you downloaded and select it.

If you followed these steps correctly, the mod you downloaded should show up in the list.
